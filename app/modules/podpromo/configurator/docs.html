        The POD Promo can accept it's data either from an endpoint accessed via AJAX or by having the model embedded directly in the Pestle component. If both sources of data exist, the end point will be the winner.

        All text displayed within the promo, as well as the image and associates src sets are controlled via the data in the JSON, and thus should be configurarble by whichever CMS is providing the data.
