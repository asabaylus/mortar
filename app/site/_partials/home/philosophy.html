    <p class="mt2_subh4">
      The styles contained in Mortar reflect National Geographic's overarching design philosophy. We pride
      ourselves on stunning, world-class visual storytelling. By keeping design elements minimal, we are able
      to allow our content to drive the visual presentation of our digital products. The design should never feel
      heavy or overpowering.
    </p>

    <p class="mt2_subh4">
      Refer to the pages in this site to create a repeatable, visual language for users interacting with the
      National Geographic brand on any digital platform. Our color palette, typographic styles, icon library, and
      page grid help to create consistent patterns, clean lines, and beautiful displays for our content.
    </p>

    <p class="mt2_subh4">
      By standardizing and documenting our design patterns in Mortar, we are striving to create one consistent
      user experience and brand identity for National Geographic across all of its digital products.
