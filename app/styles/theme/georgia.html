                Now there is only one. (Technically, yes, Vatican City is a country.) The Saudi
                women in the photo gallery below voted today, for the first time in the nation’s
                83-year history. Each of these women, it is safe to assume, cast her ballot for
                herself. The sole Saudi offices decided by public vote are seats on local councils,
                and for the 2015 elections, following a promise made by the late King Abdullah
                bin Abdulaziz, Saudi women have been permitted both to vote for their council
                members and to run as candidates—as long as they follow the rules.
